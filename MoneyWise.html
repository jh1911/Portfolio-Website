            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <ul class="plain-list">
                <li>
                    <em>Duration</em>: 2 Months
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Tools</em>: Pen & Paper, Figma, Miro, Adobe Photoshop
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Objective</em>: Creating a money saving tool for people that don't like to spend a lot of time
                    with their finances but want to reach their financial goals and save money.
                </li>
            </ul>   
            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>
                The Design Process for this proudct started with ideation, where the main goal was to create
                a money saving tool that not only looked aesthetically pleasing but also helped users achieve their
                goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                After defining the main idea, competitor research was conducted to identify what was already on the
            market and to gather insights.
            </p>
            <p>Problems to solve with this <em>Objective</em> in Mind were:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <em>The Target User</em>
                        Designing an app for users who don't like to spend time with their finances.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <em>Usability & Complexaty</em>
                    Desinging an app for users which is easy to use while incorporating complex user flows.    
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How I solved Problem #1</h3>
            <h3>Creating a brand which values Simplicity, Trust, Inclusivity & Empowerment</h3>
            <p>
                To make a finance app appealing to users who don't like to spend time with their finance I had to
                develope a <em>communicative brand</em>,
                which spreads <em>Simplicity, Trust, Empowerment & Inclusivity.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                To get to this goal I:
            </p>
            <ol class="center-aligned-list">
                <li>Developed a <em>brand</em></li>
                <li>Created a <em>style guide</em></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>From Low-Fidelity to Mid-Fidelity</h3>
            <p>
                After the brand was created I sketched out Low-Fidelity Wireframes to plan out how the app would
                function.
                From there on greyscale Mid-Fidelity prototypes were created to conduct user tests.
            </p>

            </picture>
            <h3>User Feedback:</h3>
            <p>Based on the feedback received the final UI design and mockups were created. This iterative
                    approach ensured that the product
                    meets the users' needs, was easy to use & looks aesthetically pleasing.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Fixed whitespacing and polished the visual hierarchy.</em>

            </picture>

            <h3>What I have learned from this project</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>creating a thought-out style guide can only benefit the product. It
                    sets
                    a really solid foundation for the UI design.</li>
                <li>simplifying the features of an app can greatly benefit the user by
                    allowing them to accomplish their goals more efficiently.</li>
                <li>User testing is key. Through that I was able to identify and
                    eliminate
                    pain points customers could later encounter.</li>
            </ol>
