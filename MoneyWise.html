            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Duration</em>: 2 Months</li>
                <li><em>Tools</em>: Pen & Paper, Figma, Miro, Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <li><em>Objective</em>: Creating a money saving tool for people that don't like to spend a lot of time
                    with their finances but want to reach their financial goals and save money.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>The Design Process for this proudct started with ideation, where the main goal was to create
                    a money saving tool that not only looked aesthetically pleasing but also helped users achieve their
                    goals.
                </p>
                <div>

                </div>
                After defining the main idea, competitor research was conducted to identify what was already on the
                market and to gather insights.
                <div>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Problems to solve with this <em>Objective</em> in Mind were:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <p>
                            <li><em>The Target User</em></li>
                            Designing an app for users who don't like to spend time with their finances.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li><em>Usability & Complexaty</em></li>
                            Desinging an app for users which is easy to use while incorporating complex user flows.
                        </p>

            <h3>How I solved Problem #1</h3>    
            <h2>Creating a brand which values Simplicity, Trust, Inclusivity & Empowerment</h2>
            <p>To make a finance app appealing to users who don't like to spend time with their finance I had to develope a <em>communicative brand</em>,
            which spreads <em>Simplicity, Trust, Empowerment & Inclusivity.</em></p>
            To get to this goal I:
            <ol>
                <li>Conducted <em>competitor Research</em></li>
                <li>Developed a <em>brand</em></li>
                <li>Created a <em>style guide</em></li>
            </ol>

            </picture>
            </div>
            Afterwards a Consolidated user flow was created to ensure that the app
            would meet the user user's needs.
            <div>
            </div>
            Followed by Low-Fidelity Wireframes
            to plan out how the app would function. In addition to that Mid-Fidelity prototypes were created to
            conduct user tests.
            <div>
                Based on the feedback received, the final UI design and mockups were created. This iterative
                approach ensured that the product met the needs of the user was easy to use & looks aesthetically
                pleasing.
