            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Duration</em>: 2 Months</li>
                <li><em>Tools</em>: Pen & Paper, Figma, Miro, Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <li><em>Objective</em>: Creating a money saving tool for people that don't like to spend a lot of time
                    with their finances but want to reach their financial goals and save money.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>The Design Process for this proudct started with ideation, where the main goal was to create
                    a money saving tool that not only looked aesthetically pleasing but also helped users achieve their
                    goals.
                </p>
                <div>

                </div>
                After defining the main idea, competitor research was conducted to identify what was already on the
                market and to gather insights.

                <div>
                    <p>Problems to solve with this <em>Objective</em> in Mind were:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <p>
                            <li><em>The Target User</em></li>
                            Designing an app for users who don't like to spend time with their finances.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li><em>Usability & Complexaty</em></li>
                            Desinging an app for users which is easy to use while incorporating complex user flows.
                        </p>
                    </ol>

                <h3>How I solved Problem #1</h3>
                <h2>Creating a brand which values Simplicity, Trust, Inclusivity & Empowerment</h2>
                <p>To make a finance app appealing to users who don't like to spend time with their finance I had to
                    develope a <em>communicative brand</em>,
                    which spreads <em>Simplicity, Trust, Empowerment & Inclusivity.</em></p>
                To get to this goal I:
                <ol>
                    <li>Developed a <em>brand</em></li>
                    <li>Created a <em>style guide</em></li>
                </ol>

                <h3>From Low-Fidelity to Mid-Fidelity</h3>
                <p>After the brand was created I sketched out Low-Fidelity Wireframes to plan out how the app would
                    function.
                    From there on greyscale Mid-Fidelity prototypes were created to conduct user tests.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>User Feedback:</h3>
                    <p>Based on the feedback received the final UI design and mockups were created. This iterative
                        approach ensured that the product
                        meets the users' needs, was easy to use & looks aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                    <p><em>Fixed whitespacing and polished the visual hierarchy.</em></p>

                                        <h3>What I have learned from this project</h3>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>creating a thought-out style guide can only benefit the product. It sets
                                                a really solid foundation for the UI design.</li>
                                            <li>simplifying the features of an app can greatly benefit the user by
                                                allowing them to accomplish their goals more efficiently.</li>
                                            <li>User testing is key. Through that I was able to identify and eliminate
                                                pain points customers could later encounter.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
